dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -o Data/Migrations

Difference between asynchronous request and synchronous request is that 
the thread in which synchronous request is run is blocked meaning its going
to wait for each actions to finish before it executes.

Asynchronous doesn't need to wait i.e. non blocking on the thread. It also
help with scalability especially when querying the database with complicated 
queries which takes time we need to make our calls asynchronous.

How this works is that it make use of a delegate (i.e. passing the function to another function) to help execute 
the task and once that is done the delegate notifies us that I am done and wait for others to complete.

Architecture
From the solution root run the command below
dotnet new 	classlib -o Core
dotnet new 	classlib -o Infrastructure

add reference Infrastructure to the API project.
we cd into API and run the command below

dotnet add reference ../Infrastructure

cd in to Infrastructure and add reference to the Core project 
dotnet add reference ../Core/

cd into the root solution which is skinet and run the code for restore
dotnet restore

Migration
dotnet ef --startup-project .\API migrations add InitialCreate -p .\Infrastructure -o Data/Migrations  
OR
dotnet ef --startup-project API/ migrations add InitialCreate -p Infrastructure/ -o Data/Migrations

THEN
dotnet ef --startup-project .\API database update
OR
dotnet ef --startup-project .\API database update

SWITCH IDE'S from code to visual studio


dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef
